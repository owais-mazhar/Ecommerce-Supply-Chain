# E-commerce Supply Chain Analysis

## Problem Statement
This analysis project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce supply chain dataset. The dataset includes information about different products, their pricing, availability, sales, revenue, customer demographics, stock levels, lead times, order quantities, shipping details, transportation modes, and associated costs. The goal is to derive insights that can help optimize the supply chain, reduce costs, and enhance overall efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

- Product type
- SKU
- Price
- Availability
- Number of products sold
- Revenue generated
- Customer demographics
- Stock levels
- Lead times
- Order quantities
- Shipping times
- Shipping carriers
- Shipping costs
- Supplier name
- Location
- Lead time
- Production volumes
- Manufacturing lead time
- Manufacturing costs
- Inspection results
- Defect rates
- Transportation modes
- Routes
- Costs

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values.
- Check for duplicates and remove if necessary.
- Ensure data types are appropriate for analysis.

### 2. Data Wrangling
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure.
- Perform any necessary transformations or feature engineering.
- Aggregate or filter data as needed.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize sales trends for different product types.
- Analyze the impact of shipping carriers on revenue.
- Investigate stock levels and lead times.
- Explore defect rates and inspection results.

### 4. Supply Chain Optimization
- Identify products with high revenue and optimize stock levels.
- Recommend improvements in shipping carriers and modes.
- Provide insights on lead times and order quantities.
- Suggest strategies for reducing manufacturing costs.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly for data visualization

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a requirements file is provided).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`analysis.ipynb`) to run the analysis step by step.

## Results and Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and insights obtained from the analysis. Discuss any actionable recommendations for optimizing the e-commerce supply chain, improving efficiency, and reducing costs.
